# Heartbeat Checklist

Periodic health check. Run through this list silently.

## Check

- [ ] Any pending tasks in `active-tasks.md`?
- [ ] Reminders scheduled for today in daily log?
- [ ] Session context size healthy (< 32K tokens)?
- [ ] Any lessons or self-review items to log?

## Rules

- If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`
- If action needed, perform it and report briefly
- Do NOT message the user unless something requires their attention
- Keep heartbeat responses under 200 characters
