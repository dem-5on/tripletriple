# HEARTBEAT.md — 30-minute Health Check

When the heartbeat triggers, check these items quickly. If everything is fine, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

## 1. Active Tasks

- Check `active-tasks.md`.
- Is the current task stalled? (No update in > 2 hours)
- If stalled, ask: "Are we stuck? Do we need to break this down?"

## 2. Session Hygiene

- Is the current session transcript too long? (> 50 messages)
- If yes, propose: "Session getting large. Shall we summarize to memory and reset?"

## 3. Self-Review (Every ~4 hours)

- Has it been > 4 hours since the last entry in `self-review.md`?
- If yes, perform a quick self-critique:
  1. What has gone well?
  2. What mistakes did I make?
  3. Are we on track for the user's high-level goals?
- Log it to `self-review.md`.

## 4. Housekeeping

- Are there temporary files in the workspace that can be deleted?
