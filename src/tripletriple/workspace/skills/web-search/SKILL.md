# Web Search

Use the built-in `web_search` tool for real-time information lookups.

## When to use

- User asks about current events, news, or recent information
- User needs up-to-date facts, prices, schedules, or statuses
- You're unsure about something and need to verify
- User explicitly asks you to search or look something up

## Best practices

- **Be specific**: Use targeted search queries, not vague ones
- **Verify**: Cross-reference multiple results when accuracy matters
- **Cite**: Always mention where you found the information
- **Summarize**: Don't dump raw search results — synthesize and present clearly
- **Follow up**: If the first search doesn't answer the question, refine the query

## Tips

- For code/tech queries: include the language or framework name
- For recent events: include the year or "latest"
- For comparisons: search each item separately
- For pricing: include "pricing" or "cost" in the query
